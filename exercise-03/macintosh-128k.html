        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <article>
          <p>The Macintosh contains a single 400 KB, single-sided 3 1/2-inch floppy disk drive, dedicating no space to other internal mechanical storage. The Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> was disk-based from the beginning, as RAM had to be conserved, but this "Startup Disk" could still be temporarily ejected. One floppy disk was sufficient to store the System Software, an application and the data files created with the application.</p>
